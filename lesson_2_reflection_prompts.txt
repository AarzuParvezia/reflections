What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden file .git where all the metadatra of the initialized repository is stored and the current directory will act as a repository from then on

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A working directory is where all your files are stored, updated, created manipulated. A repository will have the different versions of the files, with each version added as there are any changes in the files whenever a commit is done. A staging are acts as interface for working directory and repository where the files are placed temporarily before committing them to the repository.
