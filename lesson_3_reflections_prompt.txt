When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I might be using a computer other than mine, I would want to have all y recent updates available. Or when I want my code to be reviewed by one of my collegues in other workstations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that I would have a track of whats in my repository and in github

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clone - a copy of repository from github to local
Branch - a side track from the main branch, to isolate the actual code from that of further updates, when required
Fork - a copy of repository from others project to your own, where you can update your code and the owner can also review the changes
